# Design System - Component Library Byetlight

The Mumble Design System provides you with guidelines, components and templates to boost the user experience of your
product.

## About

The new Mumble Design System was launched in early 2023 and will be implemented across the organization,
strengthening Mumble's brand image through consistent representation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a unified toolkit that is used by UX-designers and developers on their
projects alike to ensure all Mumble projects are appealing and have a consistent look and feel across the board by
following Mumble's design and implementation guidelines.

## Toolkit

By unifiying design elements into reusable components, development will simplify and accelerate the development of
these digital products. The guide is a living document created to meet the needs of Mumble's front-end developers
and designers. If there is a component or pattern you need or you have any other feedback, question or comment
please contact us.
